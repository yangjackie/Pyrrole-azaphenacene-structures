Naming of the folder follows the molecule numbering scheme as shown in Fig. 1 of this paper. Inside each folder, every crystal structure is given in its separate VASP POSCAR format, named as POSCAR-1, POSCAR-2 etc. A separated data (.dat) file is included which list the following properties for each crystal structure:

ID  |  LATTICE ENERY (in KJ/mol) | DENSITY (in g/cm^3) | Z' value (1 or 2)
